# Exercise 1

Create a `MotionLayout` and `MotionScene` that looks similar to a lock screen.

As a user you have to swipe up to unlock the screen.

## Animation
While swiping up

1. The `Swipe Up Label` moves from the bottom of the screen upwards and eventually goes out of the
screen so that it is not visible anymore
2. The clock also moves out of the screen (direction top) but also fades the view out (alpha goes from 0 to 1)

## Run the tests
To be able to run the tests by starting emulator and run `./test.sh`
